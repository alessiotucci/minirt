This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing.

### [`the first thing I search on youtube`](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lectures+on+ray+tracing+from+ivy+college)

#### after that I looked into my old fdf to see if  I still remember anything about the mlx graphical library from 42:
After cloning the library from this repos:
```
git@github.com:42Paris/minilibx-linux.git
```

I have to install the library needed on my ubuntu laptop
```
 sudo apt-get install libx11-dev;
 sudo apt-get install libxext-dev;
 sudo apt-get install libbsd-dev;
```
You would already know all this stuff if you read the [`docs`](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx)

Also if you're into make great Makefile, check out this post about [`Universal Compilation`](https://reactive.so/post/42-a-comprehensive-guide-to-so_long). This can be accomplished by checking uname.
