#### after that I looked into my old fdf to see if  I still remember anything about the mlx graphical library from 42:
After cloning the library from this repos:
```
git@github.com:42Paris/minilibx-linux.git
```

I have to install the library needed on my ubuntu laptop
```
 sudo apt-get install libx11-dev && sudo apt-get install libxext-dev

```
